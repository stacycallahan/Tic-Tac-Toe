# Tic Tac Toe

## Description
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! This is a player vs. player online version of the classic game.

To begin, players have the opportunity to choose their preferred symbol: X or O. Then, a starting player is randomly chosen by the program. In gameplay, players view a character-based tic tac toe grid and use matrix notation to make moves, updating the grid in real time. The game is played one time through until there is a winner or tie.

## How to Play Tic Tac Toe
- Players X and O take turns marking their symbol on a 3 by 3 grid
- The first player to mark 3 of their symbol in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If the grid is filled with neither player marking 3 of their symbol in a row, the game ends in a tie
